Challenges

- This repository is where I'll put coding challenges I've solved or am currently working on.
- Solution code is written by me and is not copied.
- If you're scratching your head wondering why I solved the problem a certain way, I'm learning 
  as I go and always looking for cleaner, more pythonic ways to accomplish a given challenge.
- After completing a challenge and passing all test cases, I will go and look to see how others 
  accomplished the task to look for ways to improve my own code going forward.
